### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Westley; Honestly, not much to introduce myself, I'm a dual-enrolled student just finishing out high school and starting college. I'm planning on working on a few bigger projects, mostly including 3d printing and CNC work, which I am very passionate about learning. I also do a bit of app development, but front-end work isn't my forte, so please forgive any of the sloppy interfaces on my applications.

#### Check out my hackatime badge!
Full disclosure, I would much rather have my WakaTime graph working, but the instructions on HackaTime are broken, and I can't figure it out.
